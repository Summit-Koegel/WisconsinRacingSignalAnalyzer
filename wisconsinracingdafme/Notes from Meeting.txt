Surya will add what Sampling Rates correspond to what signal
Add information about each signal to each title
As an example: 
	Veh Speed, mph, 5 ms
Time Interpolation (not sure if this is already like this)
	Log at lowest common denominator of the signals (essentially divide time by the fastest sample rate)
	Every sensor has spaces if it does not sample as fast as the faster sensors
As an example:
	Time:  Sensor 1 Value (rpm): Sensor 2 Value(mph):
	1	5000			6
	2	5000			-
	3	4000			-
	4	5000			7
	5	5000			-
	6	5000			-

Surya will also add Sensor Plausible Min and Maxes
	If the sensor exceeds these values, that means there is something wrong, replace value with error
