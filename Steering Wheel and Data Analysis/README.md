[2022] Creation of Linux Steering Wheel

Problem
=======
The current steering wheel's display is difficult to
code and increases the time spent in the maintenece of
the code.

Solution
========
Moving to a linux based system on Raspberry Pi provides
a chance to use better graphics libraries (Python). 
Since this will be an entirely new code base, this warrants
the creation of a new project within the repository.

Notes
=====
The Raspberry Pi's hardware allows for use of more than 
just the display and pinouts. Bluetooth and wifi 
functionalities should be looked into.

Testing
=======
This project will be tested on its communications protocols, 
graphical display, and backend processing.
